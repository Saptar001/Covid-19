# Covid-19
In this Repository I have predicted and forecasted the covid cases in India using Time Series Analysis. Here I have predicted the cases using Prophet.

 ## Time Series Analysis
 
Time series analysis has many different objectives, depending on the field of application. These include forecasting future values of the series, extracting a signal hidden in noisy data, discovering the mechanism by which the data are generated, simulating independent realizations of the series to see how it might behave in the future (and hence, for example, to estimate the probability of extreme events like floods), and eliminating the seasonal component from data sets.

## Prophet

Time series forecasting can be challenging as there are many different methods you could use and many different hyperparameters for each method.

The Prophet library is an open-source library designed for making forecasts for univariate time series datasets. It is easy to use and designed to automatically find a good set of hyperparameters for the model in an effort to make skillful forecasts for data with trends and seasonal structure by default.
